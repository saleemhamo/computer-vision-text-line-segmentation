# Text-Line  Extraction  for  Arabic  Handwritten Documents

n  this  project,  we  used classical  computer  vision  techniques to  extract  text  lines  of  Arabichandwritten  documents.  The  main  goal  was  to extract  each  line  and  distinguish  it  from  others. The main challanges were the overlapping among lines  and  the  non  uniform  distribution  of  whitespaces in each document. However, our goals have been  achieved  by  using  various  techniques  organized  in  three  approaches,  firstly,  we  followed the  trivial  solution  to  extract  lines  that  are  non overlapped  using  Horizontal  Line  Projection,  af-ter that, we thought of improving the first solutionby using dynamic programming and (Divide andConquer) approach, in which we dealt with eachsub-column  alone  and  obviously,  better  resultsshown up. Finally, we used Connected ComponentAnalysis to extract lines based on their positionsin the original image, by preparing the image withdifferent preprocessing steps, and the best results were  achieved  in  this  part.
